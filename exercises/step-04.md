# Step 4: Push CI code to GitHub

To test the workflow and the CI pipeline, you need to commit the changes and push your branch back to the GitHub repository.\
As described earlier, each new push to the main branch should trigger the workflow.

## Your task

1. Configure the Git account with your email and name using the `git config --global user.email` and `git config --global user.name` commands.

2. The next step is to stage all the changes you made in the previous exercises and push them to your forked repo on GitHub.

**Your output should look similar to the image below:**
